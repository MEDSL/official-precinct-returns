# Precinct-Level Datasets

This is the MEDSL repository for precinct-level election returns. We periodically publish its contents to our [Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/medsl_election_returns) and [website](https://electionlab.mit.edu/data).

Migrating data and associated code here is a work in progress.
